					I’m a research-oriented AI engineer specialising in multimodal generative systems and
					retrieval-augmented generation. I graduated from Heriot-Watt University in 2025 with
					First-Class Honours in BSc Computer Science (AI).
				</p>

				<p class="mb-5 text-base sm:text-lg">
					My current work focuses on examines the trade-offs of different model architectures in a
					crop disease classification task, where I developed AgriPath-LF16, a benchmark for training
					and evaluating models under controlled lab–field domain shift. The dataset is publicly
					availble on HuggingFace.
				</p>

				<p class="mb-5 text-base sm:text-lg">
					I have previously led the development and deployment of a RAG-enhanced “Learning Buddy”
					for the Heriot-Watt student portal, and have industry experience spanning data science
					(Love For Data) and software engineering (Folio3).
				</p>

				<p class="mb-5 text-base sm:text-lg">
					My core interests lie in agentic multimodal systems, grounded reasoning, embodied AI, and
					practical safety constraints across AI.
