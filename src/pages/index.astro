			I’m a research-oriented AI engineer specialising in multimodal generative systems and retrieval-augmented generation. I graduated from Heriot-Watt University in 2025 with First-Class Honours in BSc Computer Science (AI).
		</p>

		<p class="mb-5 text-base sm:text-lg">
			My current work focuses on examines the trade-offs of different model architectures in a crop disease classification task, where I developed AgriPath-LF16, a benchmark for training and evaluating models under controlled lab–field domain shift. The dataset is publicly availble on HuggingFace.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-5 text-base sm:text-lg">
			I have previously led the development and deployment of a RAG-enhanced “Learning Buddy” for the Heriot-Watt student portal, and have industry experience spanning data science (Love For Data) and software engineering (Folio3).
		</p>

		<p class="mb-5 text-base sm:text-lg">
			My core interests lie in agentic multimodal systems, grounded reasoning, embodied AI, and practical safety constraints across AI.
